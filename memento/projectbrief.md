# Project Brief: Taskbar Cat CPU Monitor

## 1. Project Overview

This project aims to create a lightweight, engaging, and visually intuitive desktop utility for Windows that displays a running cat animation on the taskbar. The core purpose of this tool is to provide a real-time, at-a-glance representation of the system's CPU usage.

## 2. Core Functionality

- **CPU Usage Reflection**: The animation speed of the running cat will be directly proportional to the current CPU load. A faster-running cat indicates higher CPU usage, while a slower or walking cat signifies lower usage.
- **Taskbar Integration**: The application will render as a small, transparent, borderless window positioned precisely on the Windows taskbar, creating the illusion that the cat is part of the native desktop environment.
- **Low Resource Footprint**: The application will be designed to be efficient and consume minimal system resources to avoid impacting system performance.

## 3. Target Audience

The primary audience includes:
- **Developers, Power Users, and IT Professionals**: Users who need to monitor system performance but prefer a more aesthetic and less intrusive tool than traditional performance monitors.
- **General Desktop Users**: Anyone who enjoys desktop customization and wants a fun, visual indicator of their computer's activity.

## 4. Key Goals

- **Intuitive Visualization**: Provide an immediate and easy-to-understand visual cue for CPU performance.
- **Aesthetic Appeal**: Enhance the desktop experience with a playful and charming animation.
- **Seamless Integration**: Ensure the application feels like a natural part of the Windows UI.
