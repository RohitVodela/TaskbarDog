# Progress: Taskbar Cat CPU Monitor

## 1. What Works

- **Animal Switching**: The user can switch between "Dog" and "Cat" animations.
- **Graceful Exit**: The application can be closed via a system tray icon.
- **Core Application Logic**: The application is now functional and uses the provided dog images for animation. It correctly monitors CPU usage and adjusts the animation speed.
- **Window Positioning**: The main window correctly positions itself on the taskbar.
- **Project Scaffolding**: The `TaskbarCat` WPF project has been created.
- **Project Documentation**: The initial Memento documentation is in place.

## 2. What's Left to Build
- **Publish Executable**: The application needs to be published as a standalone `.exe` with the new features.

## 3. Current Status

- **Phase**: Feature Complete.
- **Next Milestone**: Publish application.

## 4. Known Issues

- None at this time.
