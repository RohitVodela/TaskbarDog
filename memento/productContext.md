# Product Context: Taskbar Cat CPU Monitor

## 1. The Problem

System performance monitoring is often a clinical and distracting experience. Traditional tools like Task Manager or other third-party widgets are functional but lack aesthetic appeal. They can be data-dense, requiring the user to parse numbers and graphs, which pulls focus from their primary tasks. There is a need for a monitoring tool that is both informative and seamlessly integrated into the user's desktop environment in a non-intrusive way.

## 2. The Solution

Taskbar Cat provides a delightful and intuitive solution by transforming the abstract concept of CPU usage into a simple, visual metaphor: a running cat.

- **If the cat is running fast**, the CPU is working hard.
- **If the cat is walking slowly or resting**, the system is idle.

This approach allows users to gauge their system's performance with a quick glance at their taskbar, without needing to interpret complex data. It turns a mundane utility into an enjoyable desktop enhancement.

## 3. User Experience (UX) Goals

- **"Glanceable" Information**: The user should be able to understand the CPU status in under a second.
- **Zero Configuration**: The application should work out-of-the-box with no setup required.
- **Unobtrusive**: The cat should live on the taskbar without covering up any critical system icons or notifications.
- **Charming & Fun**: The animation should be smooth and endearing, adding a touch of personality to the desktop.
